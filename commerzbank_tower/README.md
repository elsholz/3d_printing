# Commerzbank Tower
Simple model of the (almost) 300m tall Commerzbank Tower, located in Frankfurt. The Tower is kept as simple as possible. 
The lobby of the building is currently missing, but might be added later. It is very complex to model though, in comparison to the rest of the building.


Note for myself: Printing scale 92% (95% for spire) to match scale
