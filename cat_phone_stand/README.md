This is a remix of ayuchief's iPhone stand found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4357035
The main difference is, that I applied a decimate modifier and added a hole through the cats body through which you can put a charging cable or similar.

I suppose that the model is best printed vertically, with the head on the bottom, as removing supports when printed horizontally is a real pain.
