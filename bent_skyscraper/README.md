# Bent Skyscraper
The bent skyscraper is a residential skyscraper that focuses on luxury maisonette apartments, that each have a balcony.

Depending on the unit scale of the model, either `6.5` or `10`, the tower reaches a height of 169m or 260m, respectively. The 169m version would have 42 stories, the 260m version 63. Of that, 18 stories would have access to balconies in both versions. The smaller variant's balconies are roughly 1.5m wide, whereas the large scale variant features roughly 2.25m wide balconies.
