# Messeturm

Model of Frankfurt's [Messeturm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messeturm) (translates to Trade Fair Tower).

The model includes a socket that fits a GU 10 led lamp.
 The model is to be printed at 1000% scale, thus that the mein tower reaches 44 cm in height.
The stand has holes to be filled with concrete. 
One part of the stand has to be mirrored either on x-axis or in y-axis so that both parts fit together.
